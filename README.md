## Who am I?

My name is João and I’ve been a developer since I was sixteen. I’ve been active in web development since 2015 when I discovered Private Game Servers.

Today I live in Florianópolis with my wife. Recently I joined RaiseHands, a technology startup in Florianópolis formed by innovative people who are building a platform for management and relational evolution employee-employer and employee-society. We are trying to increase the transparency of relationships for the whole society, working with scientific means of emotional measurement, results, and management, all leading to follow and manage the powers of entrepreneurship and hard work.
